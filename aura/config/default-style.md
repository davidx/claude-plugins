# Default Style Profile

Apply these preferences to generated Aura prompts based on context.

## Style Selection Logic

**Use Linear-inspired style (config/styles/linear.md) when:**
- User explicitly mentions "linear", "linear-inspired", or "linear style"
- Building admin panels, dashboards, or internal tools
- Building productivity apps, task managers, or project management tools
- User describes it as "heavily UX-focused" or "app-like"
- Building data-dense interfaces with tables, lists, or forms

**Use Website style (below) for everything else:**
- Marketing sites, landing pages
- E-commerce, portfolios, blogs
- Content-focused pages
- Promotional or showcase sites

## Website Style (Default)

### Visual Language
- Inviting and approachable design
- Clear visual hierarchy that guides the eye
- Balance of whitespace and content
- Personality through color and typography choices

### Colors
- Background: White (#FFFFFF) or soft off-white (#FAFAFA)
- Primary: Bold, brand-appropriate color (suggest based on context)
- Text: Dark gray (#1F2937) for headings, medium gray (#4B5563) for body
- Accents: Complementary colors for CTAs and highlights

- Headings: Semibold (600) or Bold (700), larger sizes for impact
