Prompting for Typography
Master the art of typography in your designs with effective prompting techniques and font pairing strategies.

Typography is the foundation of good design. This guide will help you craft effective prompts for typography, choose the right fonts, and create balanced type systems for your projects.

Introduction to Typography Prompting
Typography plays a crucial role in design, influencing readability, hierarchy, and overall aesthetic. Properly crafted typography prompts help AI tools generate designs with a professional typographic foundation.

Elements of Good Typography
Hierarchy
Clear visual distinction between headings, subheadings, and body text that guides the reader's eye.

Readability
Appropriate font choices, sizes, and spacing that make content easy to read across different devices.

Consistency
A systematic approach to type that creates harmony throughout the design.

Why Typography Prompts Matter
Specifying typography details in your prompts helps AI tools create designs with intentional type choices rather than default options. This leads to more professional-looking designs with better readability and visual hierarchy.

Geist Sans

Condensed Fonts
Narrower versions of standard typefaces with characters that take up less horizontal space. Ideal for space-constrained layouts, headlines, and data-dense interfaces.

Typography Terminology
Font Weight
The thickness of the characters, usually ranging from 100 (thin) to 900 (black).

Font Size
The size of the characters, typically measured in pixels (px), points (pt), or relative units like rem.

Line Height
The space between lines of text, affects readability especially for longer text blocks.

Letter Spacing
The space between characters, can be adjusted for aesthetic purposes or to improve readability.

Typography Pairing
Creating effective font pairings is an art that can elevate your designs. Learn how to specify complementary fonts in your prompts.

Font Pairing Principles
The most effective font combinations create visual contrast while sharing some subtle quality that connects them. Typically, pair a distinctive headline font with a more neutral body font.

Classic Font Pairings
Serif + Sans-Serif
Playfair Display
Paired with Inter for a classic contrast that pairs the elegance of a serif display font with the clean readability of a modern sans-serif.
Create a landing page using Playfair Display for headings and Inter for body text. Use a dramatic size contrast with headings at 64px and body text at 16px.

Sans-Serif + Sans-Serif
Bricolage Grotesque
Paired with Inter for a modern, cohesive look that maintains readability while using contrast in weights rather than font types.
Design a website with Bricolage Grotesque (600 weight) for headings and Inter for body text. This creates a strong but cohesive visual hierarchy.

Serif + Serif
Merriweather
Paired with IBM Plex Serif for a sophisticated, editorial look that's perfect for longform content.
Generate a blog layout using Merriweather Bold for headings and IBM Plex Serif for body text, creating a scholarly, refined typography system.

Pairing Strategies for Prompts
1
Contrast in Classification
Pair fonts from different categories (serif + sans-serif, display + sans-serif).

Use Playfair Display for headings and Inter for body text

2
Contrast in Weight
When using fonts from the same family, create contrast with dramatic weight differences.

Use Inter Black (900) for headings and Inter Regular (400) for body text

3
Contrast in Size
Create visual interest with significant size differences between headings and body text.

Set headings to 3rem (48px) and body text to 1rem (16px)

4
Historical or Stylistic Connections
Pair fonts that share a historical period or design aesthetic.

Create a mid-century modern design using Futura for headings and Gill Sans for body text

How to Reference Fonts in Prompts
Be specific about font names
Use the exact font name instead of generic descriptions. "Use Playfair Display" is better than "use an elegant serif."

Specify weights and styles
Include weight numbers (400, 700) or names (Regular, Bold) and styles (italic) when relevant.

Include fallback options
Mention similar alternatives. "Use Inter or a similar modern sans-serif" provides flexibility.

Reference font sources
Mention "Google Fonts" or other sources to clarify where the font is available.

Responsive Typography
Learn how to create typography prompts that adapt beautifully across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Why Responsive Typography Matters
Typography that works well on a desktop might be unreadable on a mobile device. Responsive typography ensures optimal readability and visual hierarchy across all screen sizes, improving the user experience for everyone.

Responsive Typography Strategies
Fluid Typography
Font sizes that scale smoothly between minimum and maximum sizes based on screen width.

Small Screen
Large Screen
Responsive Heading
Smoothly scales between devices

Create a landing page with fluid typography that scales between mobile and desktop: • Headings: clamp(32px, 5vw, 64px) • Subheadings: clamp(24px, 3vw, 36px) • Body text: clamp(16px, 1vw, 18px)

Breakpoint-Based Typography
Font sizes that change at specific screen width breakpoints.

Small Screen
Large Screen
Responsive Heading
Smoothly scales between devices

Create a landing page with breakpoint-based typography: • Headings: 48px on desktop, 36px on tablet, 24px on mobile • Subheadings: 36px on desktop, 28px on tablet, 18px on mobile • Body text: 18px on desktop, 16px on tablet, 14px on mobile • Button text: 16px on desktop, 14px on tablet, 12px on mobile

Text Animation
Text animations can make your typography more engaging and highlight important information. When combined with thoughtful font choices, animations can greatly enhance your design:

Character Reveal
Character Reveal
Reveal text character by character, creating a typing effect. Perfect for headers and important typography elements.

Create a typing animation that reveals each character with a 50ms delay between characters for the main headline using Inter.

Word Fade Up
Word
Fade
Up
Animation
Animate words fading in and moving upward with staggered timing, creating a smooth flowing effect for headlines and quotes.

Create a staggered fade-up animation for each word in the tagline, with 100ms delay between words, using Inter font.

Letter by Letter
LetterbyLetter
Each letter appears one by one with a scaling effect, creating a dynamic and playful animation for display fonts.

Create a letter-by-letter animation that reveals each character with a subtle scale effect and 80ms staggered delay, using a bold display font.

Combined Animation
CombinedAnimation
Combines fade, slide, and blur effects letter by letter for a sophisticated entrance animation, perfect for hero headings.

Create a complex animation that fades in, slides up, and reduces blur for each letter with a 60ms staggered delay between characters using Inter at 60-80px.

Gradient Text
Gradient Animation
Apply animated gradient backgrounds to text for an eye-catching effect that elevates your typography.

Apply a moving gradient background from blue to purple to the main heading, with the gradient animating horizontally over 3 seconds in a loop.

Clipped Reveal
Clipped Reveal
Text gradually reveals through a clipping mask while sliding into position, creating a dynamic reveal effect for bold fonts.

Create a text animation that slides in with a clipping mask effect that reveals the title text from left to right over 800ms with an ease-out timing function.

Text Animation Best Practices
Keep text animations subtle and brief to avoid distracting from your content. Ensure animated text remains readable throughout the animation. For headings, choose animations that complement the font's character—elegant transitions for serif fonts, clean animations for sans-serif. Consider using animation to emphasize font weight changes or to transition between font styles. Respect user preferences by implementing reduced motion options.
